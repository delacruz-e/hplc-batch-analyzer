HPLC Batch Analyzer

This project is a Python-based analytical prototype for batch-to-batch comparison of HPLC chromatograms. The purpose of the project is to implement and validate core analytical logic used in chromatographic comparison, focusing on signal preprocessing, peak detection, retention time alignment, and peak-level comparison.

The workflow operates on synthetic chromatographic data in order to test the logic in a controlled and reproducible way. The preprocessing step performs baseline correction on the raw signal. After preprocessing, chromatographic peaks are detected using prominence and distance criteria. Each peak is represented by a structured model containing retention time, height, and integrated area.

An anchor peak, defined as the tallest detected peak, is used to estimate the retention time shift between a reference batch and a test batch. Test peaks are aligned using this estimated RT shift and matched to reference peaks within a configurable RT tolerance. The comparison identifies matched peaks, new peaks present only in the test batch, and peaks missing relative to the reference batch. For matched peaks, percent changes in peak area and height are calculated.

The quick test scripts generate synthetic chromatograms with controlled retention time shifts and scaling to validate each stage of the pipeline. The project currently does not include visualization, reporting, or ingestion of vendor-specific HPLC data files, and it is not intended for regulated or production environments.

This repository is intended as a technical foundation and demonstration of chromatographic batch comparison logic that can be extended in the future with visualization, reporting, real instrument data ingestion, or performance-critical components implemented in other languages.
